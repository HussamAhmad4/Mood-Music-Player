# 🎧 Mood Music Player

## Description  
Mood Music Player is a web app that lets users select a mood (or roll the dice with a random choice) and instantly play a **real Spotify playlist** that matches their vibe.  
The interface is inspired by the clean look of **Apple Music and Spotify** while staying simple and focused. The app remains centered on all screen sizes and dynamically switches playlists based on the selected mood.
